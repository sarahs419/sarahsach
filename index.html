    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>
      Digital Media has been such a great class this year. I’ve learned so much that I didn’t know before, like how to take better pictures, use Photoshop and Canva, create logos, and even use A.I. in my artwork. It’s been really interesting getting to explore all these tools and actually understand how to use them well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Zeng has taught me a lot and made everything easier to learn. I feel like the skills I’ve picked up in this class will definitely help me in the future, whether it’s for school, personal projects, or even a job someday. Overall, I’m really glad I took this class—it’s been super valuable and engaging.
